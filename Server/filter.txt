# IP-Filters for RainlendarServer
#
# The IP number must be defined like this: A.B.C.D/M, where M defines the number 
# of valid bits from the beginning.
# 
# Separate different profiles with ';'-char (e.g. 127.0.0.1/32=Exam;Holiday;Important;)
# Use * for all profiles (e.g. 127.0.0.1/32=*)
#
# Everything is case-sensitive! Do not use extra spaces in anywhere!
#
# This is just an example, which accepts and delivers everything else except Personal events
# unless they came from or go to 127.0.0.1. If you want to use this yourself change the 127.0.0.1
# to your own IP.
