Upgrading from 0.6 to 0.8
-------------------------
The place where the database files are created has been changed. They
are now placed in your home folder ($HOME/.rainlendarserver on Linux and
%APPDATA%\RainlendarServer on Windows). It's possible to override this
with the -t setting.


Upgrading from 0.5 to 0.6
-------------------------
If you're upgrading from 0.5 or earlier version you should note that the
event identification system has been changed in 0.6. This means that all 
events are considered unique also if they are on different clients. So, 
if you sync two clients that both have events both clients get the events 
from each other (i.e. your events get doubled). To prevent this you need 
to sync the events from one client to the others (i.e. the other clients 
must not have any events).

The fileformat that the server uses has also changed so the old ini-files 
are not used anymore.
