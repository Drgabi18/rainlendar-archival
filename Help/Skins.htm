Most of the skinning can be done from the GUI, which is probably the easiest way to modify 
the skins. However, sometimes it might be useful to do the changes directly 
in the skin files. The skin files weren't originally meant to be edited by 
hand, so some of the entries might be a bit unintuitive.<p>

The items (numbers) in an image can be placed either horizontally or 
vertically. The correct placement is determined from the dimensions of the 
image (i.e. whichever is bigger: height or width). The images must be cropped
so that they don't hold any extra space and their width (or height) must be 
divisional with the number of items in the image. The current version of 
Rainlendar supports BMP, JPG and PNG files. Them PNGs can include alpha mask.<p>

The name of the skin file can be anything that ends with ".ini".
The skins must be placed in a separate subfolders, which will give the name
to the skin. The same folder can also contain several skin ini-files.<p>

<b>New in 0.21:</b> The skin format has changed slightly. It is now possible to 
put the different parts to separate sections. The benefit from this is that you
can define the drawing order by placing the sections before each other. The sections
are drawn the order they are defined (except that background is drawn always first).
Note that dynamic items (Time and Button) are always drawn on top of the static items 
(i.e. normal calendar graphics). The Image-sections can be drawn in any place.<p>

The sections are: [Background], [Days], [Today], [Weekdays], [Month], [Year], [Event],
[WeekNumbers], [Tooltip], [Todo], [MessageBox] and [EventList]. If you use these
do not add the [Rainlendar]-section or the skin is read as old format.<p>

<b>Important!</v> If you create a skin that uses the new format you should inform the
users that it requires Rainlendar 0.21 or newer. The new skins behave quite badly in 0.20 and 
older versions.<p>

<b>BackgroundBitmapName</b><br>

<p><b><font size="4">Buttons</font></b></p>
It's also possible to add buttons to the skins. This can be only done in the skin's ini-file as there is no GUI for the buttons.
To add a button you need to create a new section called [ButtonN] where the N is a number (it can be any number as long as no other button is using it).
The buttons can have these values:<p>

<b>Window</b><br>
Defines the window where the button is placed. 0 = Calendar, 1 = Todo, 2 = MessageBox, 3 = EventList.<p>

<b>X</b><br>
X-coordinate of the button. You can also give negative values in which case the button location is calculated from the 
right edge of the skin. <p>

<b>Y</b><br>
Y-coordinate of the button.<p>

<b>BitmapName</b><br>
The button image. The image must have 3 frames (normal, pushed and hover).<p>

<b>Command</b><br>
The command that is executed when the button is pressed. It can be a normal application or a bang.<p>

<b>Enable</b><br>
Set to 0, to disable the item.

<pre>

Window=0
X=5
Y=5
BitmapName=button-left.png

<p><b><font size="4">Time items</font></b></p>
Time items show the current date or time in the calendar. They can be used to e.g. show a clock or current day.
Note that the window is updated only once per minute so you cannot use seconds in the clock (or you can but it's rather pointless).
To add a time item you need to create a new section called [TimeN] where the N is a number (it can be any number as long as no other time item is using it).
The time items can have these values:<p>

<b>Window</b><br>
Defines the window where the button is placed. 0 = Calendar, 1 = Todo, 2 = MessageBox, 3 = EventList.<p>

<b>X</b><br>
X-coordinate of the button. You can also give negative values in which case the button location is calculated from the 
right edge of the skin. <p>

<b>Y</b><br>
Y-coordinate of the button.<p>

<b>Rasterizer</b><br>
FONT = Use fonts to display the items<br>
BITMAP = Use bitmap to display the items<p>

<b>BitmapName</b><br>

1 = TopRight<br>
2 = TopCenter<br>
16 = MiddleLeft<br>
17 = MiddleRight<br>
18 = Middle<br>
32 = BottomLeft<br>
33 = BottomRight<br>
34 = BottomCenter<p>

<b>Separation</b><br>
The horizontal separation of the numbers (i.e. how close/far the numbers are
placed from each other). This is only applied with bitmaps when the number of 
components is 10. The value can be negative.<p>

<b>Digits</b><br>
Number of digits used in the values. This applies only to bitmaps.<p>

<b>Font</b><br>
The font to be used with the time items. Check below for more info about the fonts.<p>

<b>FontColor</b><br>
Color of the font defined as BGR hex-value (e.g. FontColor=44AAFF)<p>

<b>Format</b><br>
The time/date format.
Check <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_strftime.2c_.wcsftime.asp">here</a> for the format codes.<p>

<b>Enable</b><br>
Set to 0, to disable the item.

</pre>

<p><b><font size="4">Images</font></b></p>
The images are similar as buttons and time items except that they do not do anything. An image is just drawn in the window.
To add an image you need to create a new section called [ImageN] where the N is a number (it can be any number as long as no other image is using it).
The imagess can have these values:<p>

<b>Window</b><br>
Defines the window where the button is placed. 0 = Calendar, 1 = Todo, 2 = MessageBox, 3 = EventList.<p>

<b>X</b><br>
X-coordinate of the image. You can also give negative values in which case the button location is calculated from the 
right edge of the skin. <p>

<b>Y</b><br>
Y-coordinate of the image.<p>

<b>BitmapName</b><br>
The name of the image.<p>

<b>Enable</b><br>
Set to 0, to disable the item.

<pre>
[Image1]
Window=0
X=0
Y=0
BitmapName=shine.png
</pre>

<p><b><font size="4">Fonts</font></b></p>

The fonts are defined with 13 values and the name of the font all separated 
with '/'-char. The most important values are the first one which defines the 
height of the font and the last, which is the typeface name of the font. The 
height of the font is defined in logical size and not in the point size.<p>

E.g. -17/0/0/0/700/0/0/0/0/3/2/1/34/Arial<p>

The different values are in order:<p>

<li>height of font</li>
<li>average character width</li>
<li>angle of escapement</li>
<li>base-line orientation angle</li>
<li>font weight</li>
<li>italic attribute option</li>
<li>underline attribute option</li>
<li>strikeout attribute option</li>
<li>character set identifier (this is always DEFAULT_CHARSET unless UseSkinCharSet is set to 1)</li>
<li>output precision</li>
<li>clipping precision</li>
<li>output quality</li>
<li>pitch and family</li>
<li>typeface name</li>
<p>
Check <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/fontext_8fp0.asp">CreateFont()</a> in Win32 API documentation for more info.<p>

<p><b><font size="4">Profiles</font></b></p>
With profiles you can customize individual events. When you create an event 
there is a combo box which can be used to select the profile for the event. The combo box
lists the profiles that are defined in the current skin's ini-file, but 
you can also give a custom profile name. If a certain profile is not 
defined in a skin a default settings are used instead.<p>

The profiles are defined in the skin file by making a new section. The name
of the section must start with the word "Profile" (without the quotes). After
that you can put pretty much anything to make the section unique (i.e. there
cannot be two sections that have same name (i.e. the string between []-chars, 
not the "Name=" string).<p>

The profile section must have a key called Name, which will give the identity 
to the profile. The name is the one that is displayed in the Edit Event dialog.<p>

Other keys that can be in the profile section are:<p>

<li>ToolTipFontColor</li>
<li>EventBitmapName</li>
<li>EventFontColor</li>
<li>EventFontColor2</li>
<li>EventIconName</li>
<li>EventIconAlign</li>
<li>EventDrawAlways</li>
<li>EventListFontColor</li>
<li>Priority</li><p>

The values for the keys are exactly the same as defined above. The profile 
settings override the default skin settings, so for example if the default
ToolTipFontColor value is black and you create a profile that defines it
white, all events that use that profile will draw the tooltip texts white.
Note that it is not necessary to give all the keys always; you can define
just the ones that are necessary (default values are used for the missing
keys).<p>

The EventIconName, EventIconAlign and EventDrawAlways can only be used with 
the profiles. The event icon is a small image that is displayed on top of the 
event with the given profile. The align uses the same alignment system as other 
aligns (check e.g. DaysAlign for the codes). If the EventDrawAlways is set to 1 
it means that the event is drawn always on the calendar.<p>

The priority defines what is drawn on the calendar when there are several
event on the same day. The repeating events also have predefined priorities so 
that less frequently happening events have higher priority. Like this:<p>

<pre>
Daily Priority    = 10
Weekly Priority   = 20
Monthly Priority  = 30
Yearly Priority   = 40
Single Priority   = 50
</pre>

The profile's priority value is added to this to determine the actual priority
for the event. If you don't want that the recurrence pattern affects the priorities
of the events you can define them so that they are >50 apart from each other. E.g.
100, 200, 300, etc.<p>

Currently it is not possible to create/edit the profiles from the GUI. 
You need to create by hand with a text editor.<p>

E.g.<p>
<pre>
[Profile 1]
Name=Sunday
ToolTipFontColor=00DDFF
EventFontColor=DD8888

[Profile 2]
Name=Important
ToolTipFontColor=FFFFFF
EventFontColor=FFFFFF
EventFontColor2=FFFFFF
EventIconName=Icons/Lightning.png
EventIconAlign=18
</pre>
