<p>The basic configuration of the calendar is done from a
GUI which you open from the popup-menu. The settings are saved in
a <i>Rainlendar.ini</i>-file when you press the OK-button.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">General</font></b></p>

<p><b>Show event message in tooltip<br></b>
If enabled a tooltip will open when you move the mouse over a day that has an event. The tooltip will display all the day's events.

<p><b>Show message alarms<br></b>
If enabled a message box will be opened when an event is due. 

<p><b>Show all today's messages at startup<br></b>
If enabled a message box will be opened when Rainlendar is started. The message box will display all the today's events.

<p><b>Disable keyboard shortcuts<br>
</b>If enabled the keyboard shortcuts are disabled. Note that this setting doesn't apply to the global hotkeys defined in the Hotkeys-tab.</p>

<p><b>Poll wallpaper changes<br>
</b>If Rainlendar doesn't automatically notice wallpaper changes (as it should) you can enable this feature. When enabled Rainlendar checks once per second if the name of the wallpaper has been changed and if it has, the calendar is automatically refreshed. If you're using native transparency you should  keep this disabled.</p>

      <p><b>Snap to screen edges<br>
      </b>If selected the window will snap to the edges of the screen and other windows. You can deactivate the snapping by holding 
      Shift-key down while dragging the window.</p>

      <p><b>Refresh when screen resolution changes<br>
      </b>If selected the calendar is automatically refreshed when the screen 
      resolution is changed. Note that this may cause problems with some  
      games and full screen applications.</p>

      <p><b>Use separator in tooltips<br>
      </b>If selected a horizontal line is drawn between the events in the 
      tooltip.</p>

      <p><b>Show tray icon<br>
      </b>This displays the current date in your system tray. Double clicking the 
      icon toggles the window visibility.</p>

      <p><b>Hide event and todo lists when there are no items<br>
      </b>When enabled the event list and todo list will be hidden automatically 
		when they are empty. The list will appear again after a new event or 
		todo item is added.</p>

      <p><b>Use native Windows transparency<br>
      </b>If selected the calendar will use the native Windows
transparency for its alphablended window. Otherwise the alphablending is
done manually with the desktop wallpaper. Native transparency works only with Windows 2000 and XP.
You can also adjust the overall transparency value from the slider.</p>

<p><b>Enable/Disable Log</b><br>
Creates (or deletes) the Rainlendar's log-file. The log is written into the same folder where Rainlendar.dll is (usually C:\Program Files\Rainlendar). 

<p><b>Show Log</b><br>
Opens the log-file with Notepad.

<p><b>Advanced</b><br>
Opens the Rainlendar.ini with notepad. See the advanced section below.   

<p><b><font size="4">Layout</font></b></p>

      <p><b>Position</b><br>
The OnBottom makes the window to stay behind other windows
when it's activated with mouse. Normal makes the window behave like normal windows and OnTop makes the calendar to stay on top of other
windows. The OnDesktop setting is similar to OnBottom except that it
makes a child window of the desktop. The benefit from this is that
the calendar will be visible event if Explorer's "Show Desktop"
command is issued. The OnDesktop only works with Explorer shell.</p>

<p><b>Event list window<br></b>
You can define here how many days the event list will show. The "Substitute today and tomorrow" 
means that instead of using the name of the day (e.g. Monday) in the event list "Today" and "Tomorrow"
will be used.
</p>

<p><b>Movable window<br>
      </b>When selected, the calendar can be moved
with the       mouse. Please note that if the background has an alpha
mask and the desktop       is copied behind the calendar, the moving is
really slow and can cause       problems with some graphics cards. So,
I'd suggest to use this feature       only with non-alpha backgrounds or with 
      native transparency. </p>

      <p><b>Remember dialog positions<br>
		</b>This will save the place (and size) where a 
      dialog was closed last time and open it in the same location in the next 
      time.</p>
<p><b>Hide on mouse over</b><br>
This hides the calendar when the mouse is
over the       window. The calendar will reappear once the mouse is
moved off the window.       You can disable this feature temporarily by
holding Shift-key down while moving the mouse.</p>

      <p><b>Click through<br>
		</b>This passes all the mouse events through the calendar. This means
that you cannot click the calendar (or the other windows except the message box). 
     You can disable this feature temporarily by
holding Shift-key down while moving the mouse (It's not registered immediately so keep the key down for one sec before click through is disabled).</p>
<p><b>Opaque on mouse over</b><br>
Changes the window to completely opaque when the mouse is moved over the calendar. The window should
have some transparency assigned with the slider in the General-tab or otherwise this feature doesn't
do much.</p>

<p><b>Transparent on mouse over</b><br>
Changes the window transparent when the mouse is moved over the calendar. The transparency level is
set with the slider in the General-tab. Note that the window is always completely opaque when this
setting is set and the mouse is not over the window.</p>

      <p><b>Multiple calendars<br>
      </b>This defines how many months are shown in the calendar at the same 
      time. You can set the horizontal and vertical count for the months as well 
      as the the number of previous months are displayed. The &quot;Start from 
      January&quot; option shows January always as the first month. This is useful if 
      you want to show all year at the same time on the desktop.</p>
<p>The layout type defines how the calendars are placed on the grid. You can for 
example have the calendars placed in checker style or in X-shape. Just try them 
out to see how they look.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Hotkeys</font></b></p>
      <p>This page enables to add hotkeys to various actions. The hotkeys are 
      global so it's not necessary to have Rainlendar activated when pressing 
      the keys. It's adviced not to use too simple hotkeys (like Shift + A) 
      since that would execute the hotkey every time you write capital A letter.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Plugins</font></b></p>
Here is a list of installed plugins. See the Plugins page in this document for more information about them. The plugins can ge activated and deactivated from here. If the plugin has settings they can be edited by selecting the plugin from the list and pressing the Settings-button. The "Set as Default" button makes the plugin a default which basically means that it's editor (if it has one) will be used when creating new events.

<p><b><font size="4">Advanced</font></b></p>
There are also some other settings in the Rainlendar.ini that cannot be changed from the GUI. It's possible to change them directly from the Rainlendar.ini. Do not keep the config dialog open when editing the Rainlendar.ini or the settings will be overwritten when you press the OK-button. After you have edited the settings, refresh the calendar and the new sttings will be taken into use.<p>

Here's a list of the settings in Rainlendar.ini (only the ones that cannot be changed from the GUI):<p>

<b>X, 
Y, 
TodoX, 
TodoY, 
EventListX, 
EventListY</b><br>
Defines the location of the calendar, todo and event list windows.<p>

<b>MessageBoxX and MessageBoxY</b><br>
Defines the location of the Message Box. Note that the position is not pixels like in the other windows but percent of the desktop area.</p>

<b>ToolTipMaxWidth</b><br>
Defines the maximum width (in pixels) of the tooltip. If set to 0 there is no limit.<p>

<b>MessageBoxMaxWidth</b><br>
Defines the maximum width (in pixels) of the message box. If set to 0 there is no limit.<p>

<b>StartFromMonday</b><br>
If set to 1 the week will start from Monday (otherwise it's started from Sunday). This is automatically set according to your locale when Rainlendar is started the first time.<p>

<b>Week1HasJanuary1st</b><br>
If set to 1 the week 1 is the one that has January 1st. Otherwise its the one that has the year's first Thursday. This is automatically set according to your locale when Rainlendar is started the first time.<p>

<b>WeekNumberDelta</b><br>
This is an offset value for the week numbers. You can adjust the week 1 with this. Also negative numbers can be used.<p>

<b>StartHidden</b><br>
If set to 1 Rainlendar will start as hidden.<p>

<b>UseWindowName</b><br>
If set to 1 the window will have a name "Rainlendar". Useful feature e.g. with some virtual windows managers.<p>

<b>EventExecute</b><br>
Executes the given program or bang when the event is due and the message box is displayed. You can also use the
special PLAY command to play a wav-file (E.g. PLAY c:\windows\media\chimes.wav).<p>

<b>SnoozeTime</b><br>
If the message box is snoozed with right mouse button this value defines how long time it will be hidden.
The value is in seconds.<p>

<b>TrayExecuteL, 
TrayExecuteM, 
TrayExecuteR, 
TrayExecuteDL, 
TrayExecuteDM, 
TrayExecuteDR</b><br>
These define the action that is done when the tray icon is clicked with the mouse. The L, M and R mean left, middle and right mouse button and the D in front of them means double click. <p>

<b>DisableDoneList</b><br>
If set to 1, the done list is removed from the Todo-dialog and the done items will be deleted immediately instead of sending them to the done-list.<p>

<b>WheelScrollMonths</b><br>
Defines how many months are scrolled whit the mouse wheel. Set to 0 to disable the feature. You can also use negative values to swap the direction.<p>

<b>NegativeCoords</b><br>
This setting makes the position to be interpret so that the negative coordinates are relative to the bottom right corner of the desktop. It's useful for example to keep the calendar there even if you change the screen resolutions. Note that if you have enabled &quot;Movable window&quot; the negative coordinates are converted to positive when the window is moved. If you have trouble keeping the calendar on a secondary monitor try setting this to 0.</p>

<b>FadeDuration</b><br>
The time in ms that defines how long the fading effects take. Set to 0 to disable the fading.<p>
<b>GrowUpwards</b><br>
Normally when new items are added the event list and todo window grow downwards. That behaviour can be changed with this setting. You can set this to 2 if you want that the todo-window grows upwards, 8 if you want that the event list grows upwards or 10 if you want both windows to grow upwards. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER VALUES!!!</p>
</p>

<b>ShowContextMenu</b><br>
If set to 1 a context menu instead of full menu is shown when right mouse button is pressed over one of the windows.<p>

</p>
<p><b>DisableKeyboardOverride</b><br>
Disables the Shift-key override with click through and hide on mouse over. Be careful with this one: it's quite hard
to change the settings if you cannot click the windows anymore. Especially if you have hidden the tray icon too.</p>
<p><b>ConfigEditor</b><br>
Define the editor that you want to use when advanced-button is clicked in the config or skin dialog. Do not use spaces in the path or filename.</p>
